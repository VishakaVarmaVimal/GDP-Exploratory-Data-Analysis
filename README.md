# Abstract
Aim of the research is to predict the factors affecting the GDP per capita of a country and deciding what factors it is based on. We are using an Exploratory Data Analysis approach to deduce the same. EDA is mainly used to summarize data and visualize them. EDA helps us understand the main aspects of a data, the attributes that are actually important and contribute to our research, the factors of the attributes that affect the problem statement. We use a list of python libraries to help us with the same. Libraries like matplotlib is used for plotting figures, numpy is used for multidimensional arrays and matrices, pandas is used to support data analysis and so on. The following problem comes up with different queries to deduce the factors affecting the GDP of a country. Assuming the GDP of a country is dependent on the literacy rate of the country, the analysis may or may not lead to this assumption. Therefore, all attributes and predictions must be bore in mind.
